# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the CSS some more and checked jQuery replacements.

**Thoughts:** I've gotten over the hump of "i don't know CSS" and kept poking around at my own pace with the help of Tachyons.io. I feel like it'll take months to get this 'app' to where I want it to be. I'm happy that I can take away the load of jQuery, although the examples I followed didn't give the results I wanted. I find myself lost in the words sometimes, I love this book and philosophy.

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the CSS some more, changed fade animation to body since everything resizes onclick.

**Thoughts:** Glad centering is fixed, or better.

**Today's Progress:** Reverted to BassCSS for flexbox and finally got the centering I needed across screen sizes, woot!

**Thoughts:** Glad centering is at it's best. Still have to clean up font sizes and button alignments. Those share buttons are some finnicky little somethings. Coded for a couple hours and spent time reading issue threads on OOCSS/atomic css.
