# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, January 3, 2016
##### Continue Random Quote Machine (FCC)

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the CSS some more and checked jQuery replacements.

**Thoughts:** I've gotten over the hump of "i don't know CSS" and kept poking around at my own pace with the help of Tachyons.io. I feel like it'll take months to get this 'app' to where I want it to be. I'm happy that I can take away the load of jQuery, although the examples I followed didn't give the results I wanted. I find myself lost in the words sometimes, I love this book and philosophy.

### Day 2: Wednesday, January 4, 2016
##### Continue Random Quote Machine (FCC)

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the CSS some more, changed fade animation to body since everything resizes onclick.

**Thoughts:** Glad centering is fixed, or better.

### Day 3: Thursday, January 5, 2016
##### Continue Random Quote Machine (FCC)

**Today's Progress:** Reverted to BassCSS for flexbox and finally got the centering I needed across screen sizes, woot!

**Thoughts:** Glad centering is at it's best. Still have to clean up font sizes and button alignments. Those share buttons are some finnicky little somethings. Coded for a couple hours and spent time reading issue threads on OOCSS/atomic css. IDEA: leaves animation after fade out.

### Day 4: Friday, January 6, 2016
##### Continue Random Quote Machine (FCC)

**Today's Progress:** about to start

**Thoughts:** 

Good one today:

> If you want to be a great leader,
you must learn to follow the Tao.
Stop trying to control.
Let go of fixed plans and concepts,
and the world will govern itself.

> The more prohibitions you have,
the less virtuous people will be.
The more weapons you have,
the less secure people will be.
The more subsidies you have,
the less self-reliant people will be.

> Therefore the Master says:
I let go of the law,
and people become honest.
I let go of economics,
and people become prosperous.
I let go of religion,
and people become serene.
I let go of all desire for the common good,
and the good becomes common as grass.

To some this may seem crazy, but once you know, you'll want to remember.

### Day 5: Sunday, February 19th 2017
#### Restart FCC on Beta, contribute to QA

**Today's Progress:** I've been working through the new FCC curriculum and mostly college assignments. 


**Thoughts:** Haven't commited to this repo since my birthday, the 7th. Things like these make me irate, but I see the value it brings to other people. I've been enveloped in the field throughtout this hiatus but must confess a type of "failure" because I didn't keep these commits going. Whatever. I'm extremely happy FCC has updated their curriculum, it was feeling a bit dated, although it still uses react/bootstrap/jquery. Of course React will continue to be relevant but I'm going to try Rails and Vue, maybe even Elm.
